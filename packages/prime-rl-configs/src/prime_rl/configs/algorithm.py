"""Algorithm abstraction: sampling and the per-token training signal.

An algorithm is a named, self-contained config — a discriminated union keyed
on ``type`` (``grpo``, ``max_rl``, ``opd``, ``opsd``, ``sft``, ``echo``,
``reward``, ``custom``). The bundle *is* the algorithm: each variant carries
its sampling component and its credit-assignment / loss-routing parameters,
and its class defaults are the vetted setting — ``type = "opd"`` with a
teacher IS on-policy distillation; any key you set is visibly your own
assembly. There is no separate ``advantage`` sub-component and no preset layer.

Each algorithm fixes two things:

1. **Sampling** — which model generates train rollouts. ``sampling.source`` is
   a model reference: ``"policy"`` (the live policy) or an inline frozen hosted
   model.
2. **The per-token training signal** — credit assignment and loss routing,
   fused: one mapping from a finalized rollout to per-token ``(loss component,
   weight)``. Group-relative algorithms compute scalars on the orchestrator and
   ship numbers; reference-KL algorithms ship reference prefill logprobs and the
   trainer evaluates the per-token signal against the live policy. The algorithm
   determines which loss component consumes the action tokens (``rl`` / ``ce`` /
   ``ref_kl``, via the ``action_loss_type`` class declaration) and what happens
   to env-provided observation tokens (masked out by default; ``echo`` trains on
   them with weighted CE).

prime-rl only ever hosts the trainable policy. Every other model an algorithm
uses is an external OpenAI-compatible endpoint, declared inline on the
algorithm that uses it (a :class:`FrozenModelConfig`). Model roles like
"teacher" are algorithm-local vocabulary over these references; the pipeline
branches on liveness alone. The trainer is algorithm-blind: the loss is a sum
of three components (rl, ce, ref_kl), each normalized by its own global token
count; per-token component weights ship on the wire and the trainer just
executes them.
