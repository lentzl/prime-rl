description: How to launch prime-rl training runs — the `rl`, `sft`, and `inference` entrypoints, their config classes, and single-node/SLURM/dry-run modes. Use when starting a run or picking the right entrypoint.
---

# Start a run

All entrypoints run via `uv run <command>` and accept TOML configs via `@ path/to.toml` plus CLI overrides.

When running from a fresh git worktree, initialize its pinned dependencies first with
`git submodule update --init --recursive`. If reusing a synced environment from another
checkout, set `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` to that environment and prepend the worktree's
`src`, `packages/prime-rl-configs/src`, `deps/renderers`, `deps/verifiers`, and
`deps/pydantic-config/src` directories to `PYTHONPATH`. Verify representative imports
with `inspect.getfile` before launching so the run cannot silently use another checkout. If
attention can auto-resolve to FlashAttention 2, also verify that `flash_attn` imports from the
selected environment before starting the run.

## Config system at a glance

[`pydantic-config`](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/pydantic-config) — Pydantic-based TOML + CLI loader. Highlights (see the `configs` skill for full mechanics):

- Config files via `@ path` (TOML / YAML / JSON); CLI args layer on top, deep-merged with class defaults.
- Nested groups via dotted CLI paths — kebab-case on the CLI, snake_case in TOML.
- Bool toggles: bare `--flag` enables, `--no-flag` disables (nested too).
- Lists: space-separated or JSON literal. Dicts: JSON literal, deep-merged with file values.
- Optional sub-configs (`WandbConfig | None`): bare `--wandb` enables defaults; `--wandb @ wandb.toml` enables from a file; `--no-wandb` disables.
- Discriminated unions are switched by the `type` tag (e.g. `--optimizer.type muon`).
- Validation aliases let renamed fields keep working; legacy keys can be remapped in a `model_validator(mode="before")`.
- Auto-generated `--help` panels from `Field(description=...)` or PEP 224 docstrings.
- Friendly errors: required-field boxes, validator errors point at the offending flag, unknown flags get a "did you mean" hint.
- State-only optimizer offload remains enabled by default with
  `model.optim_cpu_offload = true`. It moves optimizer state to CPU between
  steps while keeping model weights and gradients on GPU.
- Full CPU optimizer offload is disabled by default. Enable it with
  `model.optim_cpu_offload = false` and `model.full_optim_cpu_offload = true`.
  It keeps a persistent BF16 compute model on GPU, stores FP32 master weights,
  moments, and accumulated gradients in pageable CPU RAM, and moves BF16 values
  through bounded pinned D2H/H2D rings. Pinned allocation therefore depends on
  `transfer_buffer_count` and the largest local tensor/chunk rather than total model
  size. It runs each optimizer chunk when its final gradient arrives and overlaps
  the BF16 weight refresh with the remaining backward.
  Offload disables gradient clipping because a global clipping norm would
  serialize the update after backward. Validation steps drain gradients and
  update synchronously after validation. Muon is not supported. Resumable
  checkpoints include the FP32 masters and optimizer state under the original
  FSDP parameter names. Offloaded AdamW uses the native multi-tensor CPU kernel
  by default. The native path transports BF16 model gradients and BF16 compute
  weights over PCIe while retaining FP32 masters, moments, optimizer arithmetic,
  and gradient accumulation. Numerics caveat: gradients reduce across ranks in
  FP32 but FSDP2 materializes them in the BF16 compute model's dtype, so offload
  rounds each reduced gradient to BF16 once — not bit-identical to the
  no-offload gradient path (the H2D weight refresh is exact: both paths round
  FP32 masters to BF16 for compute). It preallocates a bounded CUDA-event
  window and uses finite diagnostic waits; tune `max_inflight_backwards` and
  `timeout_seconds` only when the defaults are insufficient. `numa_bind`
  (default true) pins each rank to its GPU's NUMA node. It does not create a
  Gloo process group. Set `cpu_optimizer_backend = "torch"` inside the offload
  table to use fused PyTorch AdamW for debugging or parity checks.
- Enabling `full_optim_cpu_offload` raises the trainer's intra-op thread count at
  startup. Launchers export `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`, which would otherwise leave the
  bandwidth-bound CPU AdamW kernels on a single core. Each rank claims
  `cpu_count / local_world_size` threads, capped by its affinity mask, so the
  ranks on a node never oversubscribe it. This overrides `OMP_NUM_THREADS`, so
  setting it in `env_vars` does not change the offloaded optimizer's thread count.

## `rl` — RL training

Launches inference server, orchestrator, and trainer as subprocesses.

```bash
uv run rl @ examples/basic/reverse-text/rl.toml
uv run rl @ examples/basic/reverse-text/rl.toml --dry-run                                # write scripts, don't run
```

- Config: `RLConfig` (`packages/prime-rl-configs/src/prime_rl/configs/rl.py`)
- Entrypoint: `src/prime_rl/entrypoints/rl.py`
- SLURM: single- and multi-node
- Environment packages: before launching a config with a non-core verifier env id,
  verify the package imports under `uv run` (for example
  `uv run python -c "import importlib.util; print(importlib.util.find_spec('r2e_gym'))"`).
  If a local env exists under `deps/prime-envs/environments/` or
  `deps/verifiers/environments/` but does not import, install the env workspace
  members with `uv sync --all-packages` (all) or `uv sync --package prime-rl
  --package <env>` (one) — they're auto-discovered, no `pyproject.toml` edit needed.

## `sft` — SFT training

Launches torchrun internally — never call torchrun directly.

```bash
uv run sft @ examples/basic/reverse-text/sft.toml
uv run sft @ examples/basic/reverse-text/sft.toml --slurm
uv run sft @ examples/basic/reverse-text/sft.toml --dry-run
```

- Config: `SFTConfig` (`packages/prime-rl-configs/src/prime_rl/configs/sft.py`)
- Entrypoint: `src/prime_rl/entrypoints/sft.py`
- SLURM: single- and multi-node
- Online evals: an `[eval]` block (same shape as `[orchestrator.eval]`) plus `[inference]`
  makes the launcher also start the inference server, one env server per eval source, and
  an `evaluator` process. The trainer writes HF weight checkpoints at eval steps; the
  evaluator reloads them into the server from disk and runs the evals (single-node only).
  GPUs split via `deployment.num_gpus` (trainer) + `deployment.num_infer_gpus` (inference).

## `inference` — vLLM server

OpenAI-compatible API plus prime-rl custom endpoints (`/update_weights`, `/load_lora_adapter`, `/init_broadcaster`). Always use this entrypoint — never `vllm serve` directly. It starts a `vllm-router` on `server.port` (default 8000, the client-facing URL) fronting the engine on `backend_port` (default 8100); admin endpoints must target the engine port directly.

```bash
uv run inference --vllm.model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
uv run inference --vllm.model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --vllm.enforce-eager
```

Smoke checks:

```bash
curl http://<host>:<port>/health
curl http://<host>:<port>/v1/models
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}], "max_tokens": 50}'
```

- Config: `InferenceConfig` (`packages/prime-rl-configs/src/prime_rl/configs/inference.py`)
- Entrypoint: `src/prime_rl/entrypoints/inference.py`
- SLURM: single-node, multi-node, and disaggregated deployments
