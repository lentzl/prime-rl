"""Wire-field stamping for the per-token streams.

The training loss is a sum of five components — ``rl`` (importance-weighted
PG + KL), ``ce`` (masked NLL), ``ref_kl`` (reverse KL to a reference model as
the PG signal), ``sdpo`` (feedback-conditioned self-distillation), and
trainer-side model-observer ``novelty`` — each normalized by its own global
token count in the trainer. The algorithm decides which component the action tokens feed
and the per-token advantages the rl component consumes; these helpers write
the component weight streams and the advantage stream onto the
``TrainingSample`` wire fields at group finalization.
